varEC
==========

This is the repository of the varEC testpaper maker program. The program is now
under heavy reconstruction, so just a (growing) part of the program is in the
repository.

The whole program is Python 3 compatible. Python 2 compatibility will be
dropped.

History
--------
There was a Python version as early as in 2001 szeptember, and earlier was a
shell script version with a lot of sed commands.
