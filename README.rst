varEC
==========

This is the repository of the varEC testpaper maker program. The program was
written in 2002 or earlier, but it is now under heavy reconstruction, so
just a (growing) part of the program is in the repository.

The whole program is Python 3 compatible. Python 2 compatibility will be
dropped.
